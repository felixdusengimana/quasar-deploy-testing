        <b class="tw-block">What is product design?</b>

Product design is the process of imagining, conceptualising, testing, iterating and refining a product so it’s ready for its end user. Designers spend significant time on each of these steps, meaning that product design is a blend of research, strategy, industry knowledge and creative thinking.
<br><br><br>
In order to understand product design, it’s useful to define what we mean by a product.

Products can be physical things you can find on a shelf in a store, like a lightbulb or a bicycle, or they can be intangibles like software, services, experiences and even information, as with a training course or workshop. The product is the end result of a product designer’s work – it’s what is offered to the customer at the delivery stage of the product design process.

The product design process is shaped around user and business goals. A product’s success depends on how closely it lines up with user needs and how effectively it solves a user’s problems in the context of their life and work, since these factors will influence how well it sells and how profitable it is. It’s also influenced by the constraints of  the business, such as the budget available to develop it and the amount of time that can be dedicated to the design process.

For this reason, product design involves working closely both with people from within your business and from those in your target market, so you can make sure your product is on the right track all the way through its development journey..

<b class="block">Product design vs. UX</b>

Product design is closely related to UX design, since both disciplines are centred around iteratively shaping a solution around an end-user – a mode of working that’s known as Design Thinking.

So what sets the two apart?

It’s generally agreed that there are significant overlaps between the roles of product designer and UX designer. Both involve high levels of user empathy, and both dedicate significant time and energy to understanding who the user is and where they are coming from.
